# Hierarchical plant-wide causality analysis
Code for the plant-wide causality map in a  hierarchical approach for causality analysis
For more info, see the presentation, 'Final feedback_02-09-2020':
This code follows the approach named 'PS-PC1' in the presentation, and
incorporates the following tools covered in the presentation:
(1) Incoporating process knowledge by validating data-based connections
with a connectivity matrix.
(2) Incorporating process knowledge by constraining potential root causes.
(3) Tools for interpretation: Display node rankings

This code makes use of publically available toolboxes and repositories:
(1) The Multivariate Granger Causality (MVGC) Toolbox: https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/78727-the-multivariate-granger-causality-mvgc-toolbox
(2) IFAC-LoopRank: https://github.com/ProcessMonitoringStellenboschUniversity/IFAC-LoopRank
